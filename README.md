# Nardine-Here is a Blog on how i hosted a static website using cloud storage and a CDN. 

Firstly ,this the Architecture Diagram and narrations;
[User Browser] ---> [CDN (CloudFront / Azure CDN / Cloud CDN)] ---> [Cloud Storage Bucket]
                                               |
                                               ---> [Custom Domain + SSL (via DNS)]
â€¢Cloud Storage- Hosts Static files (HTML,CSS,JS,Images)
â€¢CDN- Delivers content globally with low latency 
â€¢DNS + SSL- Provides a custom domain and HTTPS Security.

This is the list of Cloud services Used.For this project i used Amazon Web Services(AWS).
â€¢Amazon S3- Stores static website Files
â€¢Amazon cloudfront- Acts as the CDN for global caching qnd faster delivery.
â€¢Amazon Route 53- Manages custom domain and DNS routing. 
â€¢AWS certificate  Manager(ACM)- Provides SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS. 

Here is a step-by -step Deployment Guide;
1.Created a storage bucket
â€¢Go to S3 ->create a bucket(eg.Bernardinestaticwebsite)
â€¢Enable public Access
â€¢Upload website files(index.html,style.css,images etc)

2.Enable static website Hosting.
â€¢In s3 ->properties ->Enable "Static website Hosting"
â€¢Set index.html as the default root object

3.Setup CDN (Cloudfront)
â€¢create a cloudfront distribution
â€¢Set S3 buckets as the origin 
â€¢Enable caching and choose "Redirect HTTP to HTTPs"

4.Connect Custom Domain
â€¢In Amazon Route 53->create a hosted zone for your domain
â€¢Update DNS records at your registrar to point to Route 53
â€¢Add an Alias record pointing to the cliyd front distribution. 

5.Add SSL/TLS for HTTPs
â€¢Request a certificate in AWS certificate Manager (ACM).
â€¢Attach the certificate to your cloud front distribution

6. Test Deployment
â€¢Visit your domain->your website should load securely. 

i hope this helps anyone trying to host a static website on AWS and to my fellow cloud architects and practitioners how did do with these steps stated. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
